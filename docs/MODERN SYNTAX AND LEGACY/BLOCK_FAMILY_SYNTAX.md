![BLOCK FAMILY SYNTAX](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VictorGugug/BlockProt-Reloaded/main/images/RELEASE%20TITLES/docs/BLOCK%20FAMILY%20SYNTAX.png)

Family expressions are a compact syntax for `blocks.yml`, `worlds.yml`, and
`auto_drop_to_inventory`. They are **always parsed** regardless of the `modern_family_blocks`
flag in `config.yml`.

`modern_family_blocks` controls startup auto-conversion in both directions:
- `true`  -> flat material lists are automatically converted to compact family expressions.
- `false` -> any existing family expressions in the file are automatically converted to flat lists.
It does not gate expression parsing (expressions are always parsed regardless of this flag).

Flipping this flag runs a synchronous, forced sweep across every list key in `blocks.yml`
(all 5 lockable lists plus `auto_drop_to_inventory.blocks`), not just the keys a GUI toggle
happens to touch. A key that is empty or placeholder-only is still normalized, so the whole
file always matches the current mode immediately after startup.

They replace flat material lists with token-based expressions that resolve dynamically
against the full family registry at startup and on `/bp reload`.

## Compression

When a key is saved in modern format, the plugin picks the shortest valid representation
per sub-family independently: direct inclusion (`CHEST BARREL`) if the selected members are
the minority, or exclusion (`*-CHEST -COPPER_CHEST`) if they are the majority. Selecting a
single block from a large sub-family no longer produces a long exclusion list for the whole
family; only that one sub-family's members are ever weighed against each other.

## Empty lists

An empty key is never written as a real empty YAML list (`[]`). In legacy (flat) mode it
is saved as two blank template lines (`-` / `-`), inviting the user to type material names
directly in their place. In modern mode it is saved as the single-element list
`- '[]'`, which is the only representation SnakeYAML round-trips safely for "nothing selected"
without corrupting the rest of the file's structure on the next save.


## Format: plain names or a bracket expression

Every list key (`lockable_tile_entities`, `lockable_blocks`, `lockable_entities`, etc.)
is a normal YAML list. Each entry is either a plain material name, one per line,
or a single quoted string wrapped in `[...]` (a family expression) standing for
many materials at once. The two forms can be mixed across different lines of the
same list.

```yaml
lockable_entities:
  - ITEM_FRAME                              # plain material
  - '[*-CHEST_BOATS -CHEST_MINECART]'       # family expression
```

Square brackets without commas are read as one family expression, not a list:
`lockable_entities: [ITEM_FRAME ACACIA_CHEST_BOAT]` resolves to nothing, since
neither word is a valid expression token, and no warning is logged for this case.
Use a plain list, or a flow-list with commas (`[ITEM_FRAME, ACACIA_CHEST_BOAT]`),
for one or two specific materials. Reach for an expression when you want a whole
sub-family, or a family minus a few exceptions.

## Expression tokens

All expressions are wrapped in `[...]` and contain space-separated tokens. The
result set starts empty; `*` or `*-TAG` populate it, `-*TAG` removes a sub-family
from it, and `NAME` / `-NAME` add or remove individual materials.

| Token    | Operation                                              | Example |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `*`      | Include all members of the family                          | `[*]` -> everything |
| `*-TAG`  | Include all members of a sub-family                         | `[*-CHEST]` -> only chests |
| `-*TAG`  | Exclude a sub-family from the current base                  | `[* -*CHEST]` -> everything but chests |
| `NAME`   | Include one material (must belong to this family)           | `[CHEST BARREL]` -> only those two |
| `-NAME`  | Exclude one material (must belong to this family)           | `[*-CHEST -COPPER_CHEST]` -> chests minus copper |

`-*TAG` with no prior `*` or `*-TAG` has nothing to remove from and resolves to
an empty set; `[-*CHEST]` alone disables nothing. To drop one sub-family while
keeping the rest, include the base first: `[* -*CHEST]`.

`NAME` and `-NAME` are validated against the family of the config key; a material
from another family is rejected with a console warning and discarded, e.g.
`[* -FLETCHING_TABLE]` under `lockable_tile_entities` drops that token since
`FLETCHING_TABLE` belongs to `BLOCKS`, not `TILE_ENTITIES`.

```yaml
lockable_tile_entities:
  - "[*]"                                  # everything
  - "[CHEST BARREL]"                       # only these two
  - "[*-CHEST *-SHELF]"                    # two sub-families
  - "[* -*SIGN]"                           # everything except the SIGN sub-family
  - "[*-FURNACE *-SHELF *-TRANSPORT *-MISC *-CHEST -COPPER_CHEST]"  # all sub-families, CHEST minus copper

lockable_blocks:
  - "[* -DRAGON_EGG]"                      # everything except one block

lockable_shulker_boxes:
  - "[*-SHULKERS -WHITE_SHULKER_BOX]"      # all shulkers minus one

lockable_entities:
  - "[*-CHEST_BOATS *-CHEST_MINECARTS *-HOPPER_MINECARTS *-ITEM_FRAMES]"

# worlds.yml - per-world example
worlds:
  survival:
    enabled: true
    auto_drop_to_inventory_enabled: true
    lockable_tile_entities:
      - "[*]"
    lockable_shulker_boxes:
      - "[*-SHULKERS -WHITE_SHULKER_BOX]"
    lockable_blocks:
      - "[* -DRAGON_EGG]"
    lockable_doors:
      - "[*]"
  creative:
    enabled: false
    lockable_tile_entities: []
    lockable_shulker_boxes: []
    lockable_blocks: []
    lockable_doors: []
```

## auto_drop_to_inventory

Resolves expressions against **all families** independently (union).
Each family processes the expression against its own members.
Sub-family tokens that do not belong to a given family are silently skipped for that family.

```yaml
auto_drop_to_inventory:
  enabled: true
  blocks:
    - "[*-SHULKERS]"                       # all shulkers auto-drop to inventory
    - "[*-SHULKERS -RED_SHULKER_BOX]"      # all shulkers except red
    - "[*]"                                # all lockable blocks across all families
    - "[*-SHULKERS *-CHEST]"              # shulkers + all chest variants

# To disable shulker auto-drop entirely:
#   Option A - set enabled: false
#   Option B - remove shulker entries from blocks list
#   Option C - do not include [*-SHULKERS] or individual shulker names
#
# Note: [-*SHULKERS] alone produces an empty set (no base inclusion = nothing to remove from).
# It will NOT disable shulkers that are listed via other entries in the same blocks list.
```
