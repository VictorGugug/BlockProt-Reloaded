# LOCKABLE BLOCKS BY FAMILY

Complete list of every block and entity that can be locked, organized by the
five families the expression parser resolves against. This is the companion
to `LOCKABLE_BLOCKS_REFERENCE.md`, which organizes the same catalog by config
key and sub-family; use whichever grouping fits the task.

Family membership is defined by the plugin's built-in family registry
(`BlockFamilyParser`): every material listed below comes from the registry's
`is*` predicates and `Family`/`SubFamily` entries. New Minecraft materials
that match the same name patterns (for example a new `*_CHEST` variant) join
the family automatically at runtime; the tables below stop at 1.21.x / 26.1
(The Copper Age).

For the expression syntax that selects these families: see
`BLOCK_FAMILY_SYNTAX.md`.
For the flat (legacy) `blocks.yml` format: see `LEGACY_BLOCKS_SYNTAX.md`.

storage of its own.

| `WAXED_OXIDIZED_COPPER_TRAPDOOR` | 1.21 |

### BED

Token: `*-BED`. A bed occupies two blocks (foot and head half). Locking
either half locks both: the plugin mirrors owner/friends/redstone data to
the paired half automatically, the same way it does for double chests and
two-block doors. Breaking, sneak-right-click menu access, and the lock-hint
message all work identically to any other `BLOCKS` family member.

| Material | MC version |

| `MAGENTA_BED` | 1.0 |

### Ungrouped

Blocks with no dedicated sub-family token. Target individually with
`MATERIAL_NAME`.

| Material | MC version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DRAGON_EGG` | 1.0 | Right-clicking teleports it. Protection blocks other players from touching it. |

| `BELL` | 1.14 | Blocks ringing by non-owners. |
| `NOTE_BLOCK` | 1.0 | Blocks pitch changes, useful for musical builds. |

| Material | MC version |
|---|---|
| `OAK_DOOR` | 1.0 |
| `SPRUCE_DOOR` | 1.8 |
| `BIRCH_DOOR` | 1.8 |
| `JUNGLE_DOOR` | 1.8 |
| `ACACIA_DOOR` | 1.8 |
| `DARK_OAK_DOOR` | 1.8 |
| `MANGROVE_DOOR` | 1.19 |

| `WAXED_EXPOSED_COPPER_DOOR` | 1.21 |
| `WAXED_WEATHERED_COPPER_DOOR` | 1.21 |
| `WAXED_OXIDIZED_COPPER_DOOR` | 1.21 |

## ENTITIES

Config key: `lockable_entities`. Storage entities and item frames.
Protection is stored in the entity's persistent data container (PDC) via
NBT-API and survives chunk reloads and server restarts. It does NOT survive
the entity being killed (the entity ceases to exist; protection data goes
with it).

**Default state:** empty (`[]`) on a fresh install, same as every other
lockable list. Run `/bp recommended blocks` for a sensible default that
enables `ITEM_FRAME` and `GLOW_ITEM_FRAME`, or configure manually via
`/bp lockables` or `blocks.yml`. Other entity types are disabled until an
admin adds them to `blocks.yml`.

### CHEST_BOATS

Token: `*-CHEST_BOATS`. Protects the inventory from player access and
hopper-pipeline extraction. `ChestBoat` is resolved at runtime via
reflection to support both 1.20.x (`org.bukkit.entity.ChestBoat`) and
1.21+ (`org.bukkit.entity.boat.ChestBoat`).

| Material | MC version |
|---|---|
| `CHEST_BOAT` | 1.19 - generic (oak) |
| `OAK_CHEST_BOAT` | 1.19 |
| `SPRUCE_CHEST_BOAT` | 1.19 |
| `BIRCH_CHEST_BOAT` | 1.19 |
| `JUNGLE_CHEST_BOAT` | 1.19 |
| `ACACIA_CHEST_BOAT` | 1.19 |
| `DARK_OAK_CHEST_BOAT` | 1.19 |
| `MANGROVE_CHEST_BOAT` | 1.19 |
| `CHERRY_CHEST_BOAT` | 1.20 |
| `PALE_OAK_CHEST_BOAT` | 1.21.4 |
| `BAMBOO_CHEST_BOAT` | 1.20 |

### CHEST_MINECARTS

Token: `*-CHEST_MINECARTS`. Protects the inventory from player access and
hopper-pipeline extraction.

| Material | MC version |
|---|---|
| `CHEST_MINECART` | 1.0 |

### HOPPER_MINECARTS

Token: `*-HOPPER_MINECARTS`. Protects the inventory from player access and
disables item-collection by the minecart.

| Material | MC version |
|---|---|
| `HOPPER_MINECART` | 1.5 |

### ITEM_FRAMES

Token: `*-ITEM_FRAMES`. Item frames and glowing item frames use entity PDC
for protection. They are part of the `ENTITIES` family and are shown in
`/bp lockables`. They are **enabled by default** in `blocks.yml`. Remove
them from the list or use the sub-family token `*-ITEM_FRAMES` to manage
them.

| Material | MC version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ITEM_FRAME` | 1.4 | Standard item frame. |
| `GLOW_ITEM_FRAME` | 1.17 | Glowing variant, always illuminated. |

**How to protect an item frame:**

1. Sneak and right-click the frame with an empty hand.
2. The BlockProt protection menu opens (owner assignment, friends).
3. Once protected: non-owners cannot rotate or swap the displayed item, and
   cannot break the frame.

**Admin override:** players with `blockprot.user.admin` always bypass frame
protection.

Example `blocks.yml` to enable all entity types including frames:
```yaml
lockable_entities:
  - "[*]"
```

Enable only storage vehicles and keep frames disabled:
```yaml
lockable_entities:
  - "[*-CHEST_BOATS *-CHEST_MINECARTS *-HOPPER_MINECARTS]"
```
