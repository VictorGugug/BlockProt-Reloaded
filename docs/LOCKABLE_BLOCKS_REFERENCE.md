![LOCKABLE BLOCKS REFERENCE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VictorGugug/BlockProt-Reloaded/main/images/RELEASE%20TITLES/LOCKABLE%20BLOCKS%20REFERENCE.png)

Complete list of every block and entity that can be locked, organized by family and sub-family.
Covers all Minecraft versions up to 1.21.x / 26.1 (The Copper Age).

For the family expression syntax used in modern mode: see `BLOCK_FAMILY_SYNTAX.md`.
For the in-game block browser and how to use it: see the `/bp lockables` section below.

## The /bp lockables command

`/bp lockables` opens a paged GUI that shows every block the family system knows about,
regardless of whether it is currently enabled or disabled on the server.

**Who can use it:** any player with the `blockprot.user.admin` permission, or any server operator.
Available in both menu mode and CLI mode — it is always accessible regardless of `use_menus`.

**What it shows:**

- Blocks with a normal icon and green **Status: ACTIVE** are currently lockable. Players can protect them.
- Blocks shown in gray with a red **Status: INACTIVE** are known to the system but disabled in `blocks.yml`.
  They are listed so admins can see exactly what is available and add them back if needed.

**Clicking a block in the GUI:**

Clicking does not open anything or change any settings. It sends a clickable message to your chat.
Click that message and the material name is copied to your clipboard, ready to paste into `blocks.yml`.

- **Left-click** a block → copies `MATERIAL_NAME` (green) — paste directly as a flat entry or as an inclusion token in a family expression
- **Right-click** a block → copies `-MATERIAL_NAME` (red) — the exclusion token to remove that material from an active sub-family

The info book in slot 46 shows the server version, your client version (if ViaVersion is installed),
and a count of how many blocks are currently active vs inactive.

`lockable_entities` uses entity NBT (persistent data container), not block NBT. Family expressions are fully supported.
All entity sub-families are **disabled by default** — the `lockable_entities` list ships empty. Add entries to enable.

## lockable_entities

Storage entities and item frames. Protection is stored in the entity's persistent data container
(PDC) via NBT-API and survives chunk reloads and server restarts. It does NOT survive the entity
being killed (the entity ceases to exist; protection data goes with it).

**Default state:** `lockable_entities` ships as an empty list. No entity type is protected until
an admin adds it to `blocks.yml`. This is intentional — entity protection has a higher
performance profile than block protection because entities are not indexed by chunk the same way.

To enable all entity types:
```yaml
lockable_entities:
  - "[*]"
```

### Sub-family: CHEST_BOATS

Token: `*-CHEST_BOATS`

Protects the inventory from player access and hopper-pipeline extraction.
`ChestBoat` is resolved at runtime via reflection to support both 1.20.x
(`org.bukkit.entity.ChestBoat`) and 1.21+ (`org.bukkit.entity.boat.ChestBoat`).

| Material | MC version |
|---|---|
| `CHEST_BOAT` | 1.19 — generic (oak) |
| `OAK_CHEST_BOAT` | 1.19 |
| `SPRUCE_CHEST_BOAT` | 1.19 |
| `BIRCH_CHEST_BOAT` | 1.19 |
| `JUNGLE_CHEST_BOAT` | 1.19 |
| `ACACIA_CHEST_BOAT` | 1.19 |
| `DARK_OAK_CHEST_BOAT` | 1.19 |
| `MANGROVE_CHEST_BOAT` | 1.19 |
| `CHERRY_CHEST_BOAT` | 1.20 |
| `BAMBOO_CHEST_BOAT` | 1.20 |

### Sub-family: CHEST_MINECARTS

Token: `*-CHEST_MINECARTS`

Protects the inventory from player access and hopper-pipeline extraction.

| Material | MC version |
|---|---|
| `CHEST_MINECART` | 1.0 |

### Sub-family: HOPPER_MINECARTS

Token: `*-HOPPER_MINECARTS`

Protects the inventory from player access and disables item-collection by the minecart.

| Material | MC version |
|---|---|
| `HOPPER_MINECART` | 1.5 |

### Sub-family: ITEM_FRAMES

Token: `*-ITEM_FRAMES`

Item frames and glowing item frames use entity PDC for protection. They are part of the
`ENTITIES` family and are shown in `/bp lockables`. They are **disabled by default** (not in
`lockable_entities`). Enable them by adding `ITEM_FRAME` and/or `GLOW_ITEM_FRAME` to
`blocks.yml`, or use the sub-family token `*-ITEM_FRAMES`.

| Material | MC version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ITEM_FRAME` | 1.4 | Standard item frame. |
| `GLOW_ITEM_FRAME` | 1.17 | Glowing variant, always illuminated. |

**How to protect an item frame:**

1. Sneak and right-click the frame with an empty hand.
2. The BlockProt protection menu opens (owner assignment, friends).
3. Once protected: non-owners cannot rotate or swap the displayed item, and cannot break the frame.

**Admin override:** players with `blockprot.user.admin` always bypass frame protection.

Example `blocks.yml` to enable all entity types including frames:
```yaml
lockable_entities:
  - "[*]"
```

Enable only storage vehicles and keep frames disabled:
```yaml
lockable_entities:
  - "[*-CHEST_BOATS *-CHEST_MINECARTS *-HOPPER_MINECARTS]"
```

## Entity protection

Entity protection covers tamed animals and villagers linked to protected workstations.
Configured under `entity_protection` in `config.yml` (legacy key: `pet_protection`).

```yaml
entity_protection:
  enabled: false              # master switch
  auto_protect_on_tame: true  # auto-protect newly tamed animals
  villager_locate_seconds: 6  # duration (1-10 s) of the particle locate effect
```

### Tamed animals

When `entity_protection.enabled: true`, owners can open the entity protection menu
by right-clicking their tamed pet with the configured menu item (default: stick).

Protection flags per pet:
- `no_damage` — blocks damage from non-owners (player attacks and projectiles)
- `no_interact` — blocks right-click (feeding, naming, etc.)
- `no_leash` — blocks leashing/unleashing by non-owners
- `no_pickup` — blocks parrot-on-shoulder pickup by non-owners

Death notification: if the owner is online when a protected pet dies, they receive a chat message.

### Villagers linked to workstations

When a villager's job site (stored in its memory) points to a protected workstation block, the
villager inherits protection from the block owner. No explicit configuration is needed — it is
automatic whenever the workstation block is locked.

Protected actions:
- Damage by non-owners (attacks and projectiles)
- Right-click interaction (trading GUI) by non-owners
- Breaking blocks within a 2×1×2 area around the workstation (horizontal 2, vertical 1)

**Locate villager button:**

In the BlockProt lock menu for a protected workstation, an Emerald button appears. Clicking it
closes the menu and starts a particle effect on the linked villager for `villager_locate_seconds`
(default 6, max 10). The particles are only visible to the player who clicked the button.
If no villager is linked to the workstation, nothing happens.

## auto_drop_to_inventory

Controls which blocks deliver their contents directly to the breaker's inventory instead of
dropping items on the ground. Spans all families — a single expression resolves against the
full lockable universe.

In legacy mode, list material names explicitly. In modern mode, use family expressions.

Legacy default (shulkers only):
```yaml
auto_drop_to_inventory:
  enabled: true
  blocks:
    - SHULKER_BOX
    - WHITE_SHULKER_BOX
    - ORANGE_SHULKER_BOX
    # ... (all 17 variants)
```

Modern equivalent:
```yaml
auto_drop_to_inventory:
  enabled: true
  blocks:
    - "[*-SHULKERS]"
```

Other useful modern expressions:
```yaml
    - "[*]"                               # every lockable block
    - "[*-SHULKERS *-CHEST]"             # shulkers + all chest variants
    - "[*-SHULKERS -WHITE_SHULKER_BOX]"  # shulkers except white
```
