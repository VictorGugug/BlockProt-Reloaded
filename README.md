Block protection plugin for Paper, Purpur, and Folia servers. Players protect chests, furnaces, barrels, doors, trapdoors, item frames, vehicles, and workstations through chest menus or native Paper Dialogs, without typing commands. This fork keeps the original NBT storage and adds the features described below.

## Philosophy

BlockProt Reloaded exists because the best ideas come from the community that uses the plugin. If you have a feature request, a bug report, or want to discuss improvements, open an issue on GitHub or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/RRcjuMr9Jd). If you are planning to contribute code or documentation, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md), and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before submitting an issue or pull request. Fragmentation into multiple forks helps nobody; every improvement belongs in one place, shared with everyone.

## Translating

Translations are managed through **[GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/10833)**.

[![GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/10833/whole_project/badge.svg)](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/10833)

The English file `translations_en.yml` is the primary reference. Missing keys fall back to English automatically without server errors.

Translations use [MiniMessage](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html) formatting (`<gold>`, `<bold>`, `<#a3c6eb>`, `<gradient:red:blue>`). Legacy `&` and `§` color codes are still accepted, so older translation files keep working. Write `\<player>` when a literal `<` must be shown.

### Languages on GitLocalize

These 25 languages are bundled in `lang/` and actively accepting contributions:

ar, cs, de, en, es, fi, fr, he, hu, id, it, ja, ko, nl, pl, pt-br, ro, ru, sk, sv, th, tr, uk, zh-CN, zh-TW.

Both legacy color codes (`&a`, `&6`) and Adventure MiniMessage format (`<gold>`, `<gradient:...>`) are fully supported.

## Screenshots

### Block Lock Menu
![Block lock](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VictorGugug/BlockProt-Reloaded/main/images/main_menu.png)

The main interface for locking blocks. Sneak and right-click any lockable block to open it. The two-row inventory displays functional controls on the top row and utility options on the bottom row.

### Friend Settings
![Friend settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VictorGugug/BlockProt-Reloaded/main/images/friend_settings.png)

Add or remove friends from your protected blocks. Every friend can open the block and move items in and out; the level (Basic, Operator, Full Manager, or Custom) decides who may also open its menu, change settings, or manage friends.

### Player Settings
![Player settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VictorGugug/BlockProt-Reloaded/main/images/user_settings.png)

Configure personal preferences such as lock-on-place behavior, notification sounds, and action bar hint toggles.

### Redstone Settings
![Redstone settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VictorGugug/BlockProt-Reloaded/main/images/redstone_settings.png)

Control redstone, piston, and hopper interaction for each of your protected blocks independently.

### Block Info
![Block info](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VictorGugug/BlockProt-Reloaded/main/images/block_info.png)

View the owner, friend list, protection status, and metadata for any protected block.

### Access Log
![Access log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VictorGugug/BlockProt-Reloaded/main/images/access_log.png)

Summary of all access attempts to your protected blocks. The audit log records when friends opened or interacted with your blocks.

### Access Log Detail
![Inside log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VictorGugug/BlockProt-Reloaded/main/images/inside_log.png)

Each access record shows a timestamp, player name, and action type: opened, item taken, item placed, or access denied.

### Admin Player Block-List
![Admin view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VictorGugug/BlockProt-Reloaded/main/images/admin_view.png)

Admin inspection tool to view all blocks owned by any player, including offline players. Click any entry to teleport. Shows real block icons and lock timestamps.

## Installing

Download the latest JAR from [Releases](https://github.com/VictorGugug/BlockProt-Reloaded/releases) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/blockprot-reloaded) and place it in your `plugins/` directory. Requires **Java 21+** (Java 25 for Minecraft 26.x) and **Paper, Purpur, or Folia 1.21.7 - 26.3**.

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VictorGugug/BlockProt-Reloaded.git
cd BlockProt-Reloaded
./gradlew :blockprot-spigot:shadowJar
```

```powershell
# Windows
.\gradlew.bat :blockprot-spigot:shadowJar
```

Output is placed at `spigot/build/libs/BlockProtReloaded-VERSION.jar`.

The version suffix is controlled by `versionSuffix` in `gradle.properties`:

| Value | Output |
|---|---|
| *(blank)* | `BlockProtReloaded-1.4.1.jar` - stable release |
| `BEDev` | `BlockProtReloaded-1.4.1-BEDev.jar` - experimental pre-release |
| `hotfix.N` | `BlockProtReloaded-1.4.1-hotfix.2.jar` - targeted bugfix release, numbered when a version has several |

## File Layout

```

`blocks.yml` is generated automatically on first start. If an existing `config.yml` contains legacy block lists, those values are automatically migrated to `blocks.yml`. The player UUID cache is stored safely inside the plugin folder.

## User Interfaces

BlockProt Reloaded provides complete interface parity across three display engines:

1. **Chest Inventory GUIs:** Classic inventory screens with click protection and pagination.
2. **Native Paper Dialogs:** Seamless modal dialogs on modern Paper servers (`use_dialogs: true`), featuring an established pastel palette (`PASTEL_MINT`, `PASTEL_CORAL`, `PASTEL_GOLD`, `SOFT_BLUE`, `PASTEL_PURPLE`) without occupying the inventory.
3. **Bedrock Forms (Cumulus API):** Native touch-friendly modal forms for players connecting via Geyser and Floodgate.

### Block Lock Menu

Opened by sneaking and right-clicking any lockable block.

**Top row - functional buttons:**

| Slot | Item | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Block icon | Lock or unlock toggle |
| 1 | Redstone | Redstone, piston, and hopper settings *(storage and traversal blocks)* |
| 2 | Player Head | Manage friends and permissions |
| 3 | Name Tag | Set a custom block display name |
| 4 | Ender Pearl | Transfer block ownership |
| 5 | Emerald | Locate linked villager *(workstation blocks only)* |

The redstone button is automatically hidden for display-only blocks such as signs, lecterns, and workstations. Button positions remain fixed so muscle memory is preserved across block types.

**Bottom row - utility buttons:**

| Slot | Item | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| 9 | Spyglass | Owner or staff, block has an inventory |
| 13 | Clock | Owner or staff, audit logger enabled |
| 14 | Knowledge Book | Manager role, clipboard contains copied settings |
| 15 | Paper | Manager role |
| 16 | Compass | Manager role or admin |
| 17 | Barrier | Always displayed (close menu) |

Copying settings sends an action bar confirmation. Pasting replaces the friend list rather than appending, preventing stale permission accumulation.

## Commands

Command visibility is controlled by `use_menus` in `config.yml`. When `use_menus: false`, all subcommands are available via chat. When `use_menus: true`, players only get `/bp user` and `/bp admin`; the console keeps every subcommand.

**Menu Commands:**

| Command | Permission | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/bp user` | `blockprot.user` | Open personal user menu or dialog |
| `/bp admin` | `blockprot.user.admin` | Open administrative control menu or dialog |

**Player Commands:**

| Command | Permission | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/bp help` | `blockprot.user` | Display available player commands |
| `/bp about` | `blockprot.user` | Display version and environment information |
| `/bp settings` | `blockprot.user` | Open personal preferences interface |
| `/bp friends` | `blockprot.user` | Manage global default friends list |
| `/bp friends addall <player>` | `blockprot.user` | Add a friend to every block you currently own |
| `/bp stats` | `blockprot.user` | Open block statistics and location list |
| `/bp transferall <player>` | `blockprot.user` | Transfer all owned blocks to another player (a single block is transferred from its lock menu) |
| `/bp disablehints` | `blockprot.user` | Toggle protection action bar hint messages |

**Admin Commands:**

With `admin_tiers.enabled: false` (the default) the Permission column applies, where "Admin" means op or `blockprot.user.admin`. With `admin_tiers.enabled: true` the Tier column applies instead: that tier or a higher one grants the command, ops count as Owner, and `blockprot.user.admin` alone reaches T2 commands only.

| Command | Permission | Tier | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/bp info <player>` | Admin | T1 | Inspect all blocks owned by a player (online or offline); prints the list when run from the console |
| `/bp unlock <player>` | Admin | T2 | Inspect or unlock protections owned by a player; lists their locked blocks when run from the console |
| `/bp lockables` | Admin | T2 | Interactive browser for all known materials with toggleable active status |
| `/bp protdel` | Admin | T3 | Bulk delete protections in a world with undo support; from the console use `/bp protdel <world> confirm` and `/bp protdel undo` |
| `/bp debug <subcommand>` | Admin or `blockprot.debug` | T3 | Run the full diagnostic suite and class coverage scans; also runs from the console at world spawn |
| `/bp reload` | Admin | Owner | Create safety backup and reload configs, blocks, and translations |
| `/bp update` | Admin | Owner | Check GitHub releases for updates with channel detection |
| `/bp integrations` | Admin | Owner | Inspect status of all third-party integrations |
| `/bp recommended <blocks\|config\|all>` | op or `blockprot.user.admin.owner` | Owner | Apply recommended configuration profiles; `undo` reverts them |
| `/bp tiers [setrole] <player> <role>` | Admin or `blockprot.user.admin.owner` | Owner | Manage staff admin tiers (t1, t2, t3, owner, custom, none) and admins.yml |

The console can run every command.

## Permissions

| Permission | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `blockprot.user` | true | Standard player features: lock, friends, settings, stats, transfer |
| `blockprot.user.admin` | op | Full administrator privileges and GUI inspection |
| `blockprot.user.admin.t1` | false | Staff Tier 1 (Moderator): player block lists, read-only block info and audit logs, teleport from admin lists |
| `blockprot.user.admin.t2` | false | Staff Tier 2 (Helper): unlock, break protected blocks, container bypass, lockables GUI |
| `blockprot.user.admin.t3` | false | Staff Tier 3 (Admin): T2 plus world protection deletion, config editor, and debug |
| `blockprot.user.admin.owner` | op | Staff Tier 4 (Owner): full control, reload, update, staff role assignments |
| `blockprot.user.admin.custom` | false | Custom staff role evaluating granular action flags from admins.yml |
| `blockprot.lockmax` | false | Exemption from the `player_max_locked_block_count` limit |
| `blockprot.locklimit.<N>` | false | Assigns a custom maximum locked block limit to the player |
| `blockprot.blocks.tp` | op | Allows teleportation to blocks from statistics and admin block lists |
| `blockprot.debug` | op | Access to `/bp debug` system diagnostics |

The tier nodes only take effect with `admin_tiers.enabled: true`. Every button of the `/bp admin` hub checks the tier of its action, so a staff member only uses what their tier allows.

## Key Features

### Minecraft Compatibility
Runs on Java 21 and newer (Minecraft 26.x servers need Java 25). The declared range is 1.21.7 through 26.3, and every release is tested on it in real Paper, Folia, and Purpur servers. Versions are compared numerically at runtime, so a newer patch release is not rejected at startup, but it is not tested until a later plugin release declares it.

### Native Paper Dialogs Parity
Full support for modern Paper modal dialogs (`use_dialogs: true`). Dialog menus render directly on client viewports with styled pastel themes (`PASTEL_MINT`, `PASTEL_CORAL`, `PASTEL_GOLD`, `SOFT_BLUE`, `PASTEL_PURPLE`), eliminating inventory clicking glitches and container desynchronization.

### Four-Tier Staff Hierarchy (`admins.yml`)
Configurable four-tier staff management system (`admin_tiers.enabled: true`):
- **Tier 1 (Moderator):** Player block lists (`/bp info`), a read-only lock menu on other players' blocks with block info and the audit log, and teleporting from admin block lists.
- **Tier 2 (Helper):** Container unlock, container bypass, breaking protected blocks, and the lockables browser.
- **Tier 3 (Admin):** World-wide protection deletion, the configuration editor, world expiry, and diagnostics.
- **Tier 4 (Owner):** System reloads, updates, integrations, recommended profiles, and staff assignments.
- Custom roles can also be declared with granular action flags.

### Block Family Expressions
`blocks.yml` supports compact, expressive family expressions:
```yaml
lockable_tile_entities:
  - "[*]"                               # all tile entities
  - "[*-CHEST]"                         # only chest variants
  - "[* -*SIGN]"                        # all tile entities except signs
  - "[*-FURNACE *-CHEST]"              # furnaces and chests

lockable_shulker_boxes:
  - "[*-SHULKERS -WHITE_SHULKER_BOX]"   # all shulkers except white

lockable_entities:
  - "[*-CHEST_BOATS]"                  # all chest boat variants
  - "[*-CHEST_MINECARTS *-HOPPER_MINECARTS]"
```
Full documentation: [`docs/MODERN SYNTAX AND LEGACY/BLOCK_FAMILY_SYNTAX.md`](docs/MODERN%20SYNTAX%20AND%20LEGACY/BLOCK_FAMILY_SYNTAX.md).

### Item Frame and Vehicle Protection
Item frames, glowing item frames, chest boats, storage minecarts, and hopper minecarts are protected using the standard sneak-right-click interaction. Frames mounted directly onto locked containers link to the underlying container automatically, sharing ownership and friends without requiring duplicate protection.

### Villager Workstation Protection
Villagers whose job-site points to a protected workstation inherit its protection. Non-owners cannot trade with or damage the linked villager, and cannot break blocks in the configured radius around the workstation. An Emerald button in the workstation menu initiates a particle indicator pointing to the linked villager.

### High-Performance Hopper Protection
Hoppers are checked using a thread-safe Caffeine cache and `ProtectedBlockCache`, resolving server tick lag without needing to completely disable hopper extraction.

### Hybrid MySQL / SQLite Access Audit
Stores block protections in PersistentDataContainer / NBT on the block itself. An optional MySQL / MariaDB index mirrors block locations and trust lists so large servers can search them without scanning region files; NBT stays the source of truth. An asynchronous SQLite audit log (`blockprot_audit.sqlite`) records open, item take, item place, and access denied events.

### Per-World Configuration (`worlds.yml`)
Enable `per_worlds_config: true` to configure independent block whitelists, protection rules, and feature toggles per world.

### Inactivity Cleanup and World Expiry
Configurable automated cleanup (`inactivity_cleanup_days`) that unregisters protections belonging to players who have been offline for extended periods.

## Developer API

Other plugins can query and react to BlockProt protections. The API is published through [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#VictorGugug/BlockProt-Reloaded); use a release tag (for example `1.4.0`) as the version.

Gradle (Kotlin DSL):

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven("https://jitpack.io")
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly("com.github.VictorGugug.BlockProt-Reloaded:blockprot-spigot:1.4.0") { isTransitive = false }
    compileOnly("com.github.VictorGugug.BlockProt-Reloaded:common:1.4.0")
}
```

Maven:

```xml
<repository>
    <id>jitpack.io</id>
    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
</repository>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.VictorGugug.BlockProt-Reloaded</groupId>
    <artifactId>blockprot-spigot</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

Add `softdepend: [BlockProtReloaded]` (or `depend`) to your `plugin.yml`, then:

```java
BlockProtAPI api = BlockProtAPI.getInstance();
if (api != null && api.isProtected(block)) {
    UUID owner = api.getOwner(block);
    boolean allowed = api.canAccess(block, player.getUniqueId());
    List<UUID> friends = api.getFriends(block);
}
```

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `isProtected(Block)` / `getOwner(Block)` | Whether a block is locked and who owns it |
| `canAccess(Block, UUID)` | Whether a player may use the block (owner, friend, public, or unprotected) |
| `getFriends(Block)` / `isPublic(Block)` | Players the block is shared with, and whether it is public |
| `isLockable(Block)` | Whether the block type can be locked in its world |
| `isEntityProtected(Entity)` / `getEntityOwner(Entity)` | Entity protection state and owner |
| `lockBlock(Block, Player)` / `unlockBlock(Block, Player)` | Lock or unlock through the regular events |
| `registerIntegration(PluginIntegration)` | Add your own protection rules (claims, regions) |

Events in `de.sean.blockprot.bukkit.events`: `BlockProtLockEvent`, `BlockProtUnlockEvent`, `BlockAccessEvent`, `BlockAccessMenuEvent`, and `BlockLockOnPlaceEvent`. All five events are cancellable.

Call block and entity methods on the thread that owns them: the main thread on Paper, or the owning region thread on Folia.
